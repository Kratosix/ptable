This periodic table program was made so I can understand how c++ libraries, 
I got my hands dirty with nlohmann json for the first time. 
To use this progam, you can just clone it and have gcc installed and build an executable (prefereably use -std=c++2a flag while compiling for c++ 20 for better performance). 

If you wanna contribute to this project and maybe, add some extra features, go ahead and do it no problem. Issues and PRs are available too.

And if you have any questions about this project, just email me at bit1@myself.com.
